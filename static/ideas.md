# DTCGC Agenda Software Ideas
* Automatically email the agenda and some sort of custom content to the members at once.
* Create a log of past agendas and host it onto the website so that members can view the website directly.
* Create a page where the toastmaster can directly edit the current agenda using a 2-dimensional selection dropdown menu
* Change name to AgendaMaster™ 
<h6>Subject to change at anytime</h6>  

* Add a google sheets API to upload the file to google drive and convert automatically 

# TODO:
* Remove "Major Roles" suggesting feature from agenda manager
* Create a new, seperate, "Major Role Suggestion" area on the website
* Let PPR™ handle the disclaimers and allat
